## SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE (OFL) 1.1

```
PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The fonts distributed under the OFL can be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type
of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does
not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
